I have to say, my doubts about this product were quickly removed. What normally took 7 to 8 weeks only took around 6. Not only did my plants grow faster, they grew bigger and were more luscious. Daniel wasn’t kidding when he said the worm castings would bring my garden to life. What an incredible product!"
